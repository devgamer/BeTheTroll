BeTheTroll
==========

A Bukkit 1.6.4-R2.1 plugin for Minecraft that allows users to troll one another in many different ways!

Controls:

1.  Use /burn [player] [duration in ticks] to set a player on fire for a certain number of ticks. One tick = 1/20 of a second
2.  Use /lightning [player] [times] to strike a player with lightning a certain number of times.
3.  Use /pit [player] [length] [width] to dig a pit to the void that is a certain length and width.
4.  Use /tnt [player] [number of blocks] [blocks above player] to drop a certain number of primed TNT blocks onto a player from a certain height above a player.
5.  Tips: Some trolling commands that come with Bukkit and vanilla Minecraft are /nuke [player] and /clear [player] which drop harmless TNT blocks near a player and clear a player's inventory, respectively.

Permissions:

1.  BeTheTroll.burn, BeTheTroll.lightning, BeTheTroll.pit, BeTheTroll.tnt
2.  These are by default available to ops.
